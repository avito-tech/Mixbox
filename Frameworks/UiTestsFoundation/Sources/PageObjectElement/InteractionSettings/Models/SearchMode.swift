    //    Element can be not present in hierarchy, have no size, be places to some inaccessible place.

    // 2. Is there a necessity to scroll to element to check its appearance?

    // in random directions to find it (it can appear in hierarchy after that or it is already in hierarchy but
    // gestures can not be calculated until it visually appears on screen).
