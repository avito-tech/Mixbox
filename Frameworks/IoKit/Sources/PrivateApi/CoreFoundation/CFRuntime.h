    /* Registers a new class with the CF runtime.  Pass in a
     * pointer to a CFRuntimeClass structure.  The pointer is
     * remembered by the CF runtime -- the structure is NOT
     * copied.
     *
     * - version field must be zero currently.
     * - className field points to a null-terminated C string
     *   containing only ASCII (0 - 127) characters; this field
     *   may NOT be NULL.
     * - init field points to a function which classes can use to
     *   apply some generic initialization to instances as they
     *   are created; this function is called by both
     *   _CFRuntimeCreateInstance and _CFRuntimeInitInstance; if
     *   this field is NULL, no function is called; the instance
     *   has been initialized enough that the polymorphic funcs
     *   CFGetTypeID(), CFRetain(), CFRelease(), CFGetRetainCount(),
     *   and CFGetAllocator() are valid on it when the init
     *   function if any is called.
         * - copy field should always be NULL. Generic copying of CF
         *   objects has never been defined (and is unlikely).
     * - finalize field points to a function which destroys an
     *   instance when the retain count has fallen to zero; if
     *   this is NULL, finalization does nothing. Note that if
     *   the class-specific functions which create or initialize
     *   instances more fully decide that a half-initialized
     *   instance must be destroyed, the finalize function for
     *   that class has to be able to deal with half-initialized
     *   instances.  The finalize function should NOT destroy the
     *   memory for the instance itself; that is done by the
     *   CF runtime after this finalize callout returns.
     * - equal field points to an equality-testing function; this
     *   field may be NULL, in which case only pointer/reference
     *   equality is performed on instances of this class.
     *   Pointer equality is tested, and the type IDs are checked
     *   for equality, before this function is called (so, the
     *   two instances are not pointer-equal but are of the same
     *   class before this function is called).
     * NOTE: the equal function must implement an immutable
     *   equality relation, satisfying the reflexive, symmetric,
     *    and transitive properties, and remains the same across
     *   time and immutable operations (that is, if equal(A,B) at
     *   some point, then later equal(A,B) provided neither
     *   A or B has been mutated).
     * - hash field points to a hash-code-computing function for
     *   instances of this class; this field may be NULL in which
     *   case the pointer value of an instance is converted into
     *   a hash.
     * NOTE: the hash function and equal function must satisfy
     *   the relationship "equal(A,B) implies hash(A) == hash(B)";
     *   that is, if two instances are equal, their hash codes must
     *   be equal too. (However, the converse is not true!)
     * - copyFormattingDesc field points to a function returning a
     *   CFStringRef with a human-readable description of the
     *   instance; if this is NULL, the type does not have special
     *   human-readable string-formats.
     * - copyDebugDesc field points to a function returning a
     *   CFStringRef with a debugging description of the instance;
     *   if this is NULL, a simple description is generated.
     *
     * This function returns _kCFRuntimeNotATypeID on failure, or
     * on success, returns the CFTypeID for the new class.  This
     * CFTypeID is what the class uses to allocate or initialize
     * instances of the class. It is also returned from the
     * conventional *GetTypeID() function, which returns the
     * class's CFTypeID so that clients can compare the
     * CFTypeID of instances with that of a class.
     *
     * The function to compute a human-readable string is very
     * optional, and is really only interesting for classes,
     * like strings or numbers, where it makes sense to format
     * the instance using just its contents.
